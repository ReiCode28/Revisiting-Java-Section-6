# Arrays

`Revisiting Java`

`In "Revisiting-Java", I will continue to practice and strengthen my core java skills. Beginning with the Java Fundamentals and then later with Object Oriented Programming.`

In this section, I go over the Java Fundamentals that I learned at Zip Code: Arrays

- Arrays
- Looping Arrays
- Updating Arrays
- 2D Arrays


<b>ArraysAndLoops</b>

Using for loop to run through arrays

<b>IntroToArrays</b>

Storing values in an array

<b>Reference Trap</b>

Here I go over the reference trap. 
- Trap: When you set arrays equal to each other
- Pitfall: Both variables point to each other
- Solution: Create a new array then copy every value using a for loop.
- Better Solution: Set it equal to a copy of the array using “Arrays.copyOf”

<b>TDarrays</b>

Practice working with 2D Arrays

<b>UpdatingArrays</b>

Practiced updating Arrays by copying one array to another and manually updating the indexes.

# Small Projects

<b>Javapedia</b>

A simple encyclopedia app that can be edited. 
- User submits information about famous historical figures
- Javapedia prints the contents from its "database" (a 2D array)
- User can search popular figures by name.

<b>Tic Tac Toe</b>

A simple two player game of tic tac toe.
- Board is displayed
- Players can choose a position on the board and place either an 'X' or an 'O'
- Checkwin() function checks for a win in every row, column, left diagonal, and right diagonal to determine the winner.
